# Woo-Sync-MailChimp-Subscriptions
A WordPress Plugin for syncing WooCommerce Subscribers with a MailChimp List


This plugin syncs all your active WooCommerce Subscriptions to a specified MailChimp list using the secure MailChimp API, and dynamically changes the value of a custom MERGE field to match the current status of your customer.

For example, if you have a website with a membership option, where users are required to pay every month to get access to special content/products, this plugin allows you to target only those members via MailChimp campaigns and offer special content and promotions only to those who have an active membership.

Once a user purchases a subscription, their status on MailChimp would change to *"active"*, and when the subscription is canceled - the status changes to *"canceled"*, so you could target only customers who have had a subscription in the past and don't have one now.

Combined with the [MailChimp Segments](https://mailchimp.com/help/getting-started-with-segments/) feature, this is the best tool for websites managers with subscriptions.This plugin syncs all your active WooCommerce Subscriptions to a specified MailChimp list using the secure MailChimp API, and dynamically changes the value of a custom MERGE field to match the current status of your customer.
